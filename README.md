## Running

The project needs `Webpack` installed for packaging:

```
npm install -g webpack
```

Install all the dependencies (currently just Typescript loader)

```
npm install
```

Building:

```
webpack
```

Running is as simple as loading `index.html` in your favourite server.
I did not add an auto-refresh live server since it's dangerous the reload the page and lose precious iterations.
